    "description": "# Only God can judge me, Epic edition #13/13\nThe aim of this work is to create a contrast between the icons of popular culture (2pac and Basquiat's crown) and the baroque and renaissance styles, as well as to pay homage to the old European masters: Velázquez, Caravaggio, Rembrant, Rubens.... I present 2pac as an angel in reference to his song *'Only God can judge me'*.",
